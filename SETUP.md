# Project Setup Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to set up your environment, including Apache, MySQL, and Docker, for developing and deploying a Flask application. This guide also includes a detailed explanation of the Docker configuration.

## 1. Setting Up Apache and MySQL Using XAMPP

### 1.1 Installing XAMPP

1. Download XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Install XAMPP on your system by following the on-screen instructions.

### 1.2 Starting Apache and MySQL

1. Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.
2. Start **Apache** by clicking the "Start" button next to it.
3. Start **MySQL** by clicking the "Start" button next to it.

### 1.3 Configuring MySQL

- If there is a port conflict, you can change the MySQL port:
  1. Click "Config" next to MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel.
  2. Select "my.ini" and change `port=3306` to another port, such as `3307`.
  3. Save the file and restart MySQL.

### 1.4 Accessing phpMyAdmin

- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` to manage your MySQL databases.

## 2. Setting Up Flask with Docker

### 2.1 Project Structure

Here’s the recommended project structure:

```
/UptitudeCourseTracker/
│
├── /app/                            # Application directory
│   ├── /static/                     # Static files (CSS, JS, Images)
│   ├── /templates/                  # HTML templates
│   ├── /routes/                     # Application routes
│   ├── /models/                     # Database models
│   ├── /services/                   # Business logic and services
│   ├── /utils/                      # Utility functions
│   ├── /config/                     # Configuration files
│   ├── /logs/                       # Log files
│   ├── app.py                       # Entry point for the Flask application
│   └── extensions.py                # Extensions like SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate
│
├── /migrations/                     # Database migration files
├── venv/                            # Virtual environment
├── .env                             # Environment variables
├── .gitignore                       # Files to ignore in version control
├── Dockerfile                       # Dockerfile for containerizing the application
├── docker-compose.yml               # Docker Compose file for defining multi-container applications
├── requirements.txt                 # Python dependencies
└── README.md                        # Project documentation
```

### 2.2 Docker Configuration

#### 2.2.1 Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is used to build the Docker image for your Flask application.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Navigate to the app directory within the container
WORKDIR /app/app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_ENV=development

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Explanation**:
- **FROM python:3.12-slim**: Starts with a minimal Python 3.12 image to keep the Docker image size small.
- **WORKDIR /app**: Sets the working directory inside the Docker container to `/app`.
- **COPY . /app**: Copies the contents of your project directory on your local machine into the `/app` directory in the Docker container.
- **WORKDIR /app/app**: Sets the working directory inside the container to the `app` subdirectory where `app.py` is located.
- **RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt**: Installs the Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **EXPOSE 5000**: Makes port 5000 available for the Flask application so it can be accessed externally.
- **ENV FLASK_ENV=development**: Sets the environment variable to indicate the application is in development mode.
- **CMD ["python", "app.py"]**: The command to start your Flask application when the Docker container launches.

#### 2.2.2 docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services that will run in Docker.

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
```

**Explanation**:
- **version: '3.9'**: Specifies the version of Docker Compose being used.
- **services**: Defines the services that Docker will run.
  - **web**: This is the service name for your Flask application.
    - **build: .**: Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
    - **ports**: Maps port 5000 on the container to port 5000 on your host machine, making your Flask app accessible via `http://localhost:5000/`.
    - **volumes**: Mounts the current directory to `/app` inside the container, allowing you to edit files locally and see the changes reflected immediately.
    - **environment**: Sets environment variables inside the Docker container, such as the Flask environment mode.

### 2.3 Building and Running the Docker Container

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/UptitudeCourseTracker
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Access the Flask Application**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/` to view your Flask application running in Docker.

## 3. Testing and Verifying the Setup

### 3.1 Testing Flask
- Ensure that your Flask application is accessible via `http://localhost:5000/`.
- You should see a message like "Hello, Dockerized Flask!" indicating that your application is running successfully in Docker.

### 3.2 Managing MySQL in XAMPP
- Access `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` to manage your MySQL databases using phpMyAdmin.

## 4. Notes and Considerations

- **Hosting Without Docker**: If you deploy your application to a hosting service that does not support Docker, you can omit the Docker-related files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) and set up your application traditionally by configuring the server to run your Flask application and connect to MySQL.
- **Docker Advantages**: Docker provides a consistent environment, making development, testing, and deployment easier and more reliable.

This documentation should help you and others in your team set up and maintain your development environment with Apache, MySQL, and Docker. If you need to adjust any part of the setup for different environments or hosting platforms, you can refer back to this guide for reference.
